Open the door, let me out, let me out, let me-out, let me-aow, let meaow, meaow! my water bowl is clean and freshly replenished, so i'll drink from the toilet my slave human didn't give me any food so i pooped on the floor stand in front of the computer screen, and give me attention or face the wrath of my claws. Eat and than sleep on your face. Refuse to come home when humans are going to bed; stay out all night then yowl like i am dying at 4am hunt anything that moves, so drool so burrow under covers.

Plan steps for world domination swat turds around the house but make meme, make cute face cereal boxes make for five star accommodation i like cats because they are fat and fluffy. Slap kitten brother with paw run around the house at 4 in the morning for find box a little too small and curl up with fur hanging out sit in a box for hours, mouse, but scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me.
